# [project name]

## Project Goal
:point_right: Replace this text with a pithy description of the goal of the data analysis project.


## Background & Design
:point_right: Replace this text with a slightly longer (but still only max 250 words) description of the project background and its design. 


## Roadmap
:point_right: Insert graphic of planned project releases. [This site](https://app.diagrams.net/) allows you to build a graphic that is connected to GitHub, so that changes you make are treated as GitHub commits.


## Contents
:point_right: This section should introduce the content that is published on `main`. Example:


#### 2021-07-01 SPR Poster
This is a description of the poster. There is a matching folder in the repo.

:point_right: When you first set up this readme file, you might replace everything under "Contents" here with something like "Watch for our first release!"


## Work in Development
This `main` branch contains completed releases for this project. For all work-in-progress, please switch over to the `dev` branches.

:point_right: Keep the "Work in Development" text above as the default NDCLab "blurb" to help visitors navigate the repo. But delete this note before publishing the readme file.
