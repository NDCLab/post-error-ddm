# Post-Error Drift Diffusion Modeling (DDM)

## Project Goal
Modeling post-error behaviors to examine individual differences.


## Background & Design
Anxiety emerges in late childhood and early adolescence, a period in which cognitive control is developing [(Padilla et al., 2014)](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.fiu.edu/science/article/pii/S1388245713011346?casa_token=GueROdbwdvAAAAAA:akgkzK2aBuLLN8jeaduLrD-VnqBI7tFP2hNQxRG3AdWqB7AIg-KeAD9p6nGyLQ0GRSf4yVWmkA). Cognitive control, specifically error monitoring by way of the error-related negativity (ERN), has been studied as a predictor for anxiety [(Buzzell, Troller-Renfree, et al., 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29173744/). Error monitoring involves the detection of errors which influences the regulation of behavior [(Botvinick et al., 2001)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11488380/). Current literature has focused mainly on the initial detection of errors (error monitoring) and has largely neglected the implementation of cognitive control after errors, post-error processing [(Schroder & Moser, 2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3972447/). Furthermore, it remains unknown why anxiety is associated with reduced error monitoring in younger children, but increased error monitoring during the transition to adolescence and into adulthood [(Meyer, 2017)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-45029-007). 

This project utilizes drift diffusion modeling to examine post-error behavior and its relationship to anxiety across age.
