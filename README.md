# Post-Error Drift Diffusion Modeling (DDM)

## Project Goal
Modeling post-error behaviors to examine individual differences.


## Background & Design
Social anxiety emerges in late childhood and early adolescence, a period in which cognitive control is developing (Padilla et al., 2014). Cognitive control, specifically error monitoring by way of the error-related negativity (ERN), has been studied as a predictor for social anxiety (Buzzell, Troller-Renfree, et al., 2017). Error monitoring involves the detection of errors which influences the regulation of behavior (Botvinick et al., 2001). Although the connection between error monitoring and social anxiety during childhood-adolescence is well documented (Lahat et al., 2014), it remains unsolved why the ERN relates to social anxiety. Current literature has focused mainly on the initial detection of errors (error monitoring) and has largely neglected the implementation of cognitive control after errors, post-error processing. While traditional theories posit that post-error processing is improved after error monitoring, this is not always the case (Buzzell, Beatty, et al., 2017), and performance-based fears in social anxiety may impact the attention allocated to errors.
