These files are the code used for the manuscript "Exploring the role of post-error processing in social anxiety across age".

The files are as follows: 
1. AgePEPinSA_prepCode.R: code used to clean and label data before computational modeling 
2. AgePepinSA_SSP-DDM-Code.R: computational modeling code 
3. simSSP_model_GB_noScale.cpp: CPP file used in the SSP-DDM code 
4. AgePEPinSA_analysisCode.R: code used to process files after computational modeling

The data files used in and generated by these scripts are found in this repository: post-error-ddm/input
