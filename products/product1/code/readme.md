# Product1: Code

### Instructions
Copy here the code used to postprocess and analyze the raw input data. This is a duplicate of the code in this repository's `code/' folder and serves the purpose of creating a self-contained unit enabling another researcher to replicate your findings.

Update the header above to replace "Product1" with a more descriptive name of the publication.

If input data is modified after the code to generate the publication is run (for instance, to correct an error), the code mut be re-run and the results checked for any differences.
