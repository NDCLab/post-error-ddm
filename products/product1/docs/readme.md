# Product1: Docs

### Instructions
This folder contains all iterations of the manuscript or poster:

**draft**

The working draft of the manuscript or poster.

**submit_2021-01-01**

The official submission. The folder name should be updated to reflect the actual submission date.

**review_2021-01-01**

Create a new dated folder for each round of review. Reviewer notes should be placed in `incoming-review/` and the response, including any updated submission materials, should be placed in `outgoing-response/`. So, if there are three rounds of reviewer feedback, there would be three "review_" folders, each ending with a different date.

**pub_2021-01-01**

The accepted, proofread manuscript or poster.


Update the header above to replace "Product1" with a more descriptive name of the publication.
