# Products

### Instructions
This folder contains subfolders, one for each product released from the analysis effort. Code and results are duplicated here to create a self-contained unit enabling another researcher to replicate from raw input data (as indicated in the `input/` folder) to final results. The `docs/` folder contains drafts and submissions for posters and papers.
