# Derivatives

### Instructions
Post-processed versions of the data are stored in this folder. Organize each post-processing step in a logical order and name subfolders accordingly (e.g., "2021-09-15_description-of-postprocessing-step"). 

Pre-processing should not be included in this repository; instead, pre-processing code and derivatives should be maintained in the `derivatives/preprocessed/` folder of an associated dataset repository.

**Note:** This folder is explicitly untracked in this repo's .gitignore file because data files are too large to be stored on GitHub.
